# COMP90041_Project_Cribbage
This is the course Project for COMP90041(Programming and Software Development).

The objective of this project is to practice your Java programming skills. This project is a departure from the earlier assessed labs, in that the assessment will focus on code quality, as well as correctness. You should allocate a few hours to tidying up your code after your implementation is complete. You will make comments on three of your peers’ projects’ coding and documentation style, and will receive feedback from your peers on your submission.
